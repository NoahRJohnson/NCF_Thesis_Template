# NCF_Thesis_Template
Bare-bones tex files for a New College of Florida undergraduate thesis. Based on MIT thesis template. Recommend Tex-Studio to compile. In order to cite, make sure Biber is installed. Then use \cite{nameOfRef} in .tex files, where nameOfRef is the name of one of the entries in your .bib file. Then compile, run "biber main.bcf" from the command line, and recompile.
